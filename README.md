# TurnBasedStrategyCourse
 
This is a cloning project that created by following the https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-turn-based-strategy/ course. In this project I learned and get comfortable using C# events, struct, interfaces, delegates and c# generics. This course helped me to write cleaner codes and expand my knowledge around game development in Unity.
